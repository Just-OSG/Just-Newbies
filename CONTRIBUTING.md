# Contributing to Just-Newbies

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Just-Newbies! 
We welcome contributions from everyone, and you don't need to be a coding expert to make a difference. 
If you've mastered a topic to the point where you can explain it in simple words -so clearly that even a 5-year-old child could understand it,
then we need you!

## Writing Content Contributions

This is a community-to-community work, and we highly value human-written explanations. 
Your unique perspective, experience, and way of explaining concepts are what make this project special.
You can contribute to existing chapters or articles by improving explanations, adding examples, or suggesting better ways to present information. 
You're also encouraged to suggest entirely new topics that you think would benefit newcomers in the field. 
Whether it's simplifying technical jargon, creating relatable analogies, or restructuring content for better clarity.

Your name will always reside in the articles you've helped create or improve,
ensuring you receive proper recognition for your contributions to the community.
We value every contributor and believe in giving credit where credit is due.

**Important:** We strongly discourage the use of AI for writing academic content. We want authentic, 
human-written explanations that come from your genuine understanding and teaching experience. 
This personal touch is what resonates with learners and creates real educational value.

#### Where to find the content files?

Just-Newbies uses the Hugo framework, where you write and modify your content only in `.md` files.  
You can modify or create new files inside the [`content/english`](https://github.com/Just-OSG/Just-Newbies/tree/main/content/english) folder for the English version and the [`content/arabic`](https://github.com/Just-OSG/Just-Newbies/tree/main/content/arabic) folder for arabic written content.  
If you don't know what an `.md` (Markdown) file is, please check out this [article](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to learn the basic syntax.

If you have an idea for a new topic that would help newbies? 
Open an issue with the "topic suggestion" label and describe what you'd like to see covered. 
Include why you think this topic is important and how it would benefit learners.


## Technical Contributions

Technical contributions include bug fixes, feature implementations, website improvements, and infrastructure enhancements.
Before you start working on any issue, you must comment under the issue you want to work on to state that you are taking it.
This helps confirm that your contribution is valid, prevents duplicated work, and keeps the workflow clear and organized.

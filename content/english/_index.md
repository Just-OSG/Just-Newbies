# Welcome to Just Newbies!

Hi folks! Congrats on taking your first step in the IT field!

Now it's just me and you dear reader, let's begin with a breif introduction...

You can google anything on earth and you'll definatly find dozens of article and youtube 
videos exaplining that topic. But what if you didn't know that topic exists?
What if you loved that topic when you first knew about it, but then you wished you knew about it eariler?
what if you found a lot of resources for that topic but they were saying some terms
that you don't yet understand! What if you kept moving back and forth between different
resources wishing to find the ultimiate perfect resources?

In the IT sector you connot be an expert in everything but you defintly should
be aware of a lot of concepts. Here's where Just Newbies shine, you'll only encounter a conversation style of writing within everything written here, 
you'll learn only the 20% of every topic, the 20% that will cover the other 80%.
according to the 20/80 rule (80% of effects come from 20% of causes).
In simple words, you don't need to know all the vocabs
to speak in a language! that applies on everything you learn in your life, only 20% of anything (the right 20%)
will be enough! sure you won't be an expert, but you'll gain the enough knowledge.

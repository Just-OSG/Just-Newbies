Web development is the process of building websites and web applications. It's divided into frontend (what users see and interact with) and backend (server-side logic and databases). With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the core technologies, web development has evolved to include powerful frameworks and tools that make creating modern, interactive websites easier than ever. It's one of the most accessible entry points into programming.

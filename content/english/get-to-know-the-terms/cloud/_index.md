Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet. Instead of owning physical servers and infrastructure, companies and individuals can rent computing resources from cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This has revolutionized how applications are built, deployed, and scaled in modern IT.
